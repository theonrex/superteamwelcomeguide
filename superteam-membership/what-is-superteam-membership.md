### What is Superteam Membership?

Superteam Membership is an exclusive program designed to bring together the most skilled and impactful contributors in the ecosystem. Members are carefully selected based on their proven track record of driving innovation and providing value to the community. This elite group represents the best of the best, united by a shared commitment to excellence and collaboration.

### Why is Membership Limited?

To cultivate a meaningful and effective community, Superteam caps membership at around 150 individuals, adhering to Dunbar’s Number—the limit of stable relationships a person can maintain. This deliberate limitation fosters a close-knit environment where members can form deep connections, share knowledge, and collaborate seamlessly to achieve impactful results. Inactive members are periodically replaced to ensure the community remains vibrant and dynamic, with opportunities for new talent to join.
