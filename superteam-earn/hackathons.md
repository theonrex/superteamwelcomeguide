A [**Superteam Hackathon**](https://earn.superteam.fun/hackathon/radar/) is an event designed to bring together developers, designers, and creators to collaborate on innovative projects within a limited timeframe. Participants work in teams to brainstorm, design, and build solutions, often focusing on specific themes or challenges related to the Solana ecosystem.&#x20;

Hackathons foster a competitive yet supportive environment, encouraging creativity and collaboration. Teams present their projects at the end of the event, and winners receive prizes, recognition, or even funding opportunities.&#x20;

These events are a great way to network, learn new skills, and turn ideas into tangible products while contributing to the vibrant crypto community.
