### **How to Get Feedback & Improve Your Designs**

Improving as a designer requires **constructive feedback and continuous learning.**&#x20;

_Here’s how to refine your skills:_

1. **Seek feedback from diverse sources** – Ask clients, peers, and target users for insights.
2. **Document your progress** – Track changes and improvements to see your growth over time.
3. **Stay updated** – Follow design trends, take online courses, and read books by experts.
4. **Develop a critical eye** – Analyze successful designs to understand what makes them work.
5. **Embrace feedback as a tool for growth** – Don’t take criticism personally; use it to improve your design.
6. **Be specific with your questions** – Instead of _"What do you think?"_, ask.&#x20;
   1. _Is the design clear and balanced_
   2. &#x20;_Does it evoke the intended emotion?_
   3. &#x20;_Are the colors and typography effective?_
