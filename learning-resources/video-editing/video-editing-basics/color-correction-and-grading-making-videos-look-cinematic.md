Color plays a crucial role in video editing, shaping the mood, storytelling, and overall aesthetic. Whether you're working on a film, a vlog, or a commercial project, understanding **color correction** and **color grading** is essential for achieving a professional look.

### **Color Correction vs. Color Grading**

✔ **Color Correction** – This is the first step, where you fix exposure, contrast, white balance, and saturation to ensure all clips look natural and consistent. The goal is to correct any color imbalances.

✔ **Color Grading** – This is the creative process of adding specific color tones and styles to evoke emotions and set the mood of the video. This is where you can give your footage a cinematic, vibrant, or dramatic feel.

* **LUTs (Look-Up Tables)** – Pre-made color grading presets that help you achieve a specific look instantly.
* **Vignettes & Film Grain** – Subtle effects that add a cinematic texture.
