## Step 3: Securely Store Your Recovery Phrase <a href="#f46b" id="f46b"></a>

During setup, you’ll receive a recovery phrase _**(a set of words that is your key to accessing your wallet)**_.

> **It’s extremely important to write this phrase down on paper and store it securely in a safe, offline location. Do not save it digitally or share it with anyone.**

Your **recovery phrase** is your ultimate access key, and losing it can lead to permanent loss of your funds. Similarly, anyone who obtains it can access your wallet and funds.

## Step 4: Confirm Your Recovery Phrase <a href="#b707" id="b707"></a>

To ensure you’ve correctly saved your recovery phrase, Solflare will guide you through a quick verification.

You’ll be asked to confirm specific words from your recovery phrase, such as “_What is the 3rd word in your recovery phrase?_”

Follow the instructions, select the correct word(s), and click **“Continue.”**

This step ensures that you’ve securely backed up your access key.
