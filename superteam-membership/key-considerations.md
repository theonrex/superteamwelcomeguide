# Key Considerations

It’s important to understand the key factors that may influence your membership eligibility:

* **Superteam Membership May Be Invitation-Only**:\
  In some cases, Superteam operates on an invitation-only basis, and membership may require a recommendation from existing members. Building relationships and demonstrating value within the community increases your chances of receiving an invitation.
* **Proof of Work is Critical**:\
  Your contributions must be tangible and impactful. Whether through winning bounties, building valuable projects, or offering strategic insights, the work you put in needs to be verifiable and recognized by the community.
