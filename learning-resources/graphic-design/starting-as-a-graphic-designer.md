* **Actively volunteer for brands** – Treat it like a real job, putting in effort and commitment. This not only helps you sharpen your skills but also allows you to build a strong portfolio.
* **Join design challenges** – Participating in these helps you analyze other designers' work, understand their tactics, and refine your skills. Plus, the projects you create can also serve as portfolio pieces.
* **Seek feedback and mentorship** – Engage with design communities, ask for critiques, and connect with experienced designers. Investing in their courses can give you direct access to their knowledge, allowing you to ask questions and improve faster.
* **Establish your presence on social media** – Position yourself as a designer by consistently sharing your work, creative process, and insights. Engaging your audience builds credibility and increases your chances of getting referrals, freelance opportunities, or internship offers.
