[Phantom](https://phantom.app/) is a non-custodial wallet and browser extension that can manage digital assets and interact with smart contracts and digital applications.&#x20;

It emerged as a brainchild of [Chris Kalani](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-kalani), [Francesco Agosti](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/francesco-agosti), and [Brandon Millman](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brandon-millman-0603), who set out to create a native Solana wallet. This non-custodial wallet is designed to seamlessly interact with assets on the Solana blockchain, offering users a convenient way to trade, receive, send, and store their assets securely. For enhanced security, Phantom is compatible with hardware wallets, including Ledger. It is accessible both as a mobile application and a browser extension.&#x20;
