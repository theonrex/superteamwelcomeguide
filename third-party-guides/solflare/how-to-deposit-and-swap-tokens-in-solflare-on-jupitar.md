Before procedding. What does swapping means in crypto?

**What is Swapping in Crypto?** Swapping in crypto refers to exchanging one type of cryptocurrency or token for another. This exchange happens instantly through a process that does not require the involvement of a central authority like a bank. Instead, it is facilitated by a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a swapping platform.

**How Does It Work?** When you want to swap one crypto token for another:

1. **Choose Tokens to Swap**: You select the token you have and the token you want in return.
2. **Exchange Rate Calculation**: The exchange platform calculates the conversion rate based on market prices, which can fluctuate rapidly.
3. **Liquidity Pools**: To perform the swap, decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity pools, which are collections of tokens provided by other users. These pools ensure that there is enough of each token available for trading.
4. **Execution**: The swap happens, and you’ll see the equivalent amount of the new token appear in your wallet, minus a small transaction fee.

**Example with Jupiter on Solana:** Suppose you use **Jupiter**, a popular decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain. Here’s how it works:

* **Aggregating Liquidity**: Jupiter connects with multiple decentralized exchanges and liquidity sources to find the best rates for your swap.
* **Efficiency**: Instead of you manually searching different platforms to get the best price, Jupiter automatically routes your transaction through the best available path for a cost-effective swap.

**Why People Use Swapping:**

1. **Trading and Investing**: Quickly convert tokens for trading opportunities.
2. **Access to Different Tokens**: Gain access to new tokens without using traditional exchanges.
3. **Portfolio Management**: Balance or diversify your crypto holdings.

**An Analogy:** Think of swapping like exchanging currencies at an airport currency exchange counter. If you’re traveling from the U.S. to Europe, you might swap U.S. dollars for euros. In crypto, instead of fiat currencies like dollars or euros, you are exchanging digital assets such as SOL (the native token of Solana) for USDC (a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar). The process is fast, automated, and facilitated by a decentralized system.

**Key Benefits of Swapping on Jupiter:**

* **Best Prices:** Jupiter's aggregation ensures you get the most competitive exchange rates by comparing prices across multiple DEXs.
* **Reduced Slippage:** By splitting trades across different DEXs, Jupiter minimizes slippage – the difference between the expected price and the price you actually get due to market fluctuations.
* **Decentralized and Secure:** Your funds remain in your control within your own wallet throughout the entire process. Jupiter doesn't hold your cryptocurrency.
* **Fast and Efficient:** Solana is known for its speed and low transaction fees, making swaps on Jupiter quick and cost-effective.

To swap the tokens simply make sol base and jup the quote currency. Now input the amont of sol you want to swap to jup and jupitar will return the equivalent price of jup then you should click swap button and slide to approve transaction.
