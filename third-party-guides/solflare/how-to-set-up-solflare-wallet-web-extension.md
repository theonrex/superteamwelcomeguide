## Step 3: Securely Store Your Recovery Phrase <a href="#f46b" id="f46b"></a>

During setup, you’ll receive a recovery phrase _**(a set of words that is your key to accessing your wallet)**_.

> **It’s extremely important to write this phrase down on paper and store it securely in a safe, offline location. Do not save it digitally or share it with anyone.**

Your **recovery phrase** is your ultimate access key, and losing it can lead to permanent loss of your funds. Similarly, anyone who obtains it can access your wallet and funds.

To ensure you’ve correctly saved your recovery phrase, Solflare will guide you through a quick verification.

This step ensures that you’ve securely backed up your access key.
