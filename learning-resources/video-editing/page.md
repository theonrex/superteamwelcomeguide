&#x20;Tips for Beginner Video Editors

\


• Stay consistent and keep improving with practice

Avoiding Common Editing Mistakes like exporting at 720p instead or 1080p or 4k. The reason why it is of importance to export at the highest possible resolution is that when uploading to social media factors like network strength when uploading and the network strength of the consumer when viewing the media can affect the final consumed product.

When viewing videos on social media, if there is a network strength drop, the video quality reduces to accommodate the shift. Now if your video was uploaded at 720p the quality drop can be glaring depending on the device compared to if the video was uploaded at 4k.

Also, to fix the quality step-down when uploading, adjust your media upload settings to allow uploading in highest quality so even when your network strength is low, no matter how long it takes, your video will only upload at it's highest quality.

Keeping Up with Industry Trends

One advice I got one time was to not neglect tiktok as a source of inspiration as well as a place to find and take note of trending edits. The search bar is more than capable to introduce you to so much templates you'd be surprised
